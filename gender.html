                        science, analysts with the deep learning techniques can be more precise diagnosis. With certain
                        features data analysis can allow detect early signs and can advise preventive care well in
                        advance. Data Made Simple. (2019) and [Robby Gupta 2019]. Machine learning can play vital role
                        to predict heart diseases and some disorders in heart diseases. Here this project with mentioned
                        algorithms K Neighbors classifiers, SVM, DTC, RFC (Random forest classifier) has worked on
                        predicting potential heart diseases in the people. Finally, this project of heart diseases
                        prediction with different classifiers and models were examined. The percentage of accuracy are
                        written after the name of the models K Neighbors Classifier: 87%. Support Vector Classifier:
                        83%. Decision Tree Classifier: 79%. Random Forest Classifier: 84%
